👋 Hello, I'm Rafael Pato

I'm a Computer Engineering student based in Setúbal, Portugal, with a strong focus on software development and interactive systems.  
I enjoy building structured, maintainable solutions — from backend logic and algorithms to user-facing applications and games.

My background combines academic projects, real-world application development, and long-term experience in game development within international communities.

🧩 What I work with

I have hands-on experience developing applications using:

• Java (JavaFX, algorithmic problem solving, design patterns)  
• C# & ASP.NET Core (backend development, layered architectures)  
• Dart & Flutter (mobile apps with sensors, GPS, and Firebase)  
• Lua (game systems, UI logic, data persistence in Roblox)  
• SQL (database design and querying)  

Tools I use regularly include IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Git, Firebase, and SQL Server.
